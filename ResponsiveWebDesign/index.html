    <p>Hello and welcome to the most responsive page alive. This page right here,
    will respond very smoothly to each and every device in this room.
    Just put it to the test by resizing the window to the size of a tab and then
    to a smart phone's. See, magic. Now, the most important thing to learn in this
    page is that the media query is usefull and interesting. For the moment rely
    on it for a guide to to a responsive site. This page was brought to you by

    <h1>Or-Book-it-Later</h1>
<p>This side will need a paragraph on it own. It needs to be very long, so long that
sentances in it are very unusual in a way that there may be no commas or full stops.
Joking, but that was a long sentance. Now, we will try to make this one sentace
at leat abide by the rules of a formal language. The following one will find out
for you when is the right time to use a colon and a semi-colon except in coding
ofcourse. But as you might have niticed that sentance did not contain any of
the colons. But stress not because this was just a simple text to check if the div
above and the div below will behave as they were made to. One last thing,
you will notice that the above sentance is false only when the size
is still dekstop/laptop size. The 'above' and 'below' should change to
'right' and 'left' when media query kicks in. </p>
